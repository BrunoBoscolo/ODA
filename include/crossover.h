 * @brief Performs crossover between two parent networks to create a child network.
 * @details This function acts as a dispatcher, calling the appropriate underlying
 * crossover method based on the `crossover_type` parameter. The child network
 * inherits its structure from the parents but gets a new set of weights and
 * biases that are a combination of the parents' parameters.
 * @param parent1 A pointer to the first parent network.
 * @param parent2 A pointer to the second parent network.
 * @param crossover_type The crossover strategy to use (e.g., `UNIFORM_CROSSOVER`).
 * @return A new `NeuralNetwork` representing the child. The caller is
 *         responsible for freeing this new network using `nn_free()`.
 * @return `NULL` on failure (e.g., if parents are incompatible).
