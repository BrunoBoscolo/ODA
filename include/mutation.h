 * @brief Mutates a neural network's weights and biases in-place.
 * @details This function iterates through the weights and biases of the given
 * network. For each parameter, it decides whether to apply a mutation based on
 * `mutation_chance`. If a mutation occurs, the type and magnitude are determined
 * by the other parameters. The network's parameters are modified directly.
 * @param network The neural network to mutate. This network is modified directly.
 * @param mutation_rate The base magnitude of the mutation. Its interpretation depends on the mutation type.
 * @param mutation_chance The probability (0.0 to 1.0) that any single weight or bias will be mutated.
 * @param mutation_type The type of mutation to perform (e.g., `GAUSSIAN_MUTATION`).
 * @param mutation_std_dev The standard deviation for `GAUSSIAN_MUTATION`.
 * @param current_gen The current generation number, used by `NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION`.
 * @param max_gens The maximum number of generations, used by `NON_UNIFORM_MUTATION`.
 * @param fitness_std_dev The standard deviation of the population's fitness, used by `ADAPTIVE_MUTATION`.
