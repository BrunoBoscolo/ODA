 * @brief Creates a new generation of networks through selection and crossover.

 * pool using tournament selection. Two parents are chosen to create one child
 * via a specified crossover method.
 * @param fittest_networks An array of `NetworkFitness` structs representing the parent pool.
 * @param num_fittest The number of networks in the `fittest_networks` array.
 * @param new_population_size The desired number of child networks to create for the new generation.
 * @param crossover_type The crossover strategy (e.g., `UNIFORM_CROSSOVER`) to use for creating children.
 * @param tournament_size The number of individuals to compete in each parent selection tournament.
 * @return An array of pointers to the new generation of child networks.
 * @return `NULL` on failure. The caller is responsible for freeing both the
 * returned array and each `NeuralNetwork*` within it.
